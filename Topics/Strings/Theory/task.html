<div class="step-text">
<p>Like in many other programming languages, strings are commonly used in Go. However, their use here is quite different from other languages like Java, C++, Python, etc. Let's look at them in detail.</p><h5 id="strings-and-string-declaration">Strings and string declaration</h5><p>Put simply, a string is a sequence of variable-width characters, each of them represented by one or more bytes using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8?" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UTF-8 Encoding</a>. It might sound scary, but it's basically about the fact that you can put any existing symbol in it, and we will show you exactly how.</p><p>We declare a string in double quotes, and there can be special characters inside these double quotes, such as line breaks or tabs:</p><pre><code class="language-go">// The default value for string is "" or `` - empty string
var myFirstString string

// A string with special characters
var iAmSpecial = "Hello\n\t"

/*
    Escape sequence Value
    \n A newline character
    \t A tab character
    \" Double quotation marks
    \\ A backslash
*/</code></pre><p>In case you need a string that retains special characters as plain text, all you have to do is put it in backticks <code class="language-go">``</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-go">fmt.Println("ABOBA\n\t") // This string consists of the word ABOBA, a new line and tabulation
/* Output:
ABOBA
	

*/

fmt.Println(`ABOBA\n\t`) // This string consists of the word ABOBA\n\t
/* Output:
ABOBA\n\t
*/</code></pre><p>String contents are immutable in Golang, so when we concatenate two strings, it creates a new one in memory:</p><pre><code class="language-go">discover := "hello"             // the variable contains the "hello" string

discover = discover + " there"  // the variable contains a new "hello there" string;
                                // the "hello" string soon will be removed from memory

discover = "world"              // the variable again has a new value;
                                // the "hello there" string soon will be removed from memory</code></pre><p>The actual strings like <code class="language-go">"hello"</code> and <code class="language-go">"world"</code> are immutable, but you can change the value of a string variable. However, it still means that the string <code class="language-go">"hello"</code> exists somewhere in memory,  and Go will not change the contents of that memory location.</p><h5 id="utf-8">UTF-8</h5><p>Remember we mentioned the scary word UTF-8? Shortly, it means that you can have a string with symbols from almost any alphabet.</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Side note: in standard UTF-8 Unicode, character representations occupy from 1 to 4 bytes.  </p></div><pre><code class="language-go">// UTF-8 from box
var russian = "Привет, Мир!"

korean := "안녕하세요 월드입니다!"

var emoji = "🙋🌍❗"</code></pre><p>As we've mentioned earlier, each string is a sequence of bytes. Hence, if you need to find out its byte length, you can use the function <code class="language-go">len(yourStringName)</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-go">asciiString := "ABCDE"
utf8String  := "БГДЖИ"

fmt.Println(len(asciiString)) // 5
fmt.Println(len(utf8String))  // 10</code></pre><h5 id="runes">Runes</h5><p>Go uses <code class="language-go">rune</code> type values to represent Unicode characters. The Go language defines the type <code class="language-go">rune</code> as an alias for the type <code class="language-go">int32</code>, so programs can be clear when an integer value represents a codepoint. Moreover, you can assume that strings are not only sequences of bytes but sequences of runes.</p><p>Depending on the use case, strings are commonly regarded as sequences of bytes (encoded in UTF-8) when transferring data and as sequences of runes when it is required to check each individual character of the string.</p><p>Remember the example above? If you are interested in the length of a string in characters, use the function <code class="language-go">RuneCountInString</code> from <code class="language-go">unicode/utf8</code> package:</p><pre><code class="language-go">asciiString := "ABCDE"
utf8String  := "БГДЖИ"

utf8.RuneCountInString(asciiString) // 5
utf8.RuneCountInString(utf8String)  // 5

// Emoji example 🗿
emoji := 🙋🌍❗
len(emoji)                          // 11
utf8.RuneCountInString(emoji)       // 3</code></pre><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Now let's briefly remind ourselves how this topic was useful. We have learned that Go supports two styles of string literals: the double-quote style and the back-quote style (or raw string literals). The zero values of string types are blank strings, represented with <code class="language-go">""</code> or <code class="language-go">``</code> in literal. </p><p>Final remark: for safer work with strings, you should convert them into <code class="language-go">[]rune</code> , but we will cover it in detail in another topic.</p>
